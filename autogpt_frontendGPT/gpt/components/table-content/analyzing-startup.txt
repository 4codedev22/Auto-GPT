Areas for improvement in the TableContentComponent:
- The component is tightly coupled with the ExportService, which could be extracted into a separate service
- The component has multiple responsibilities, including rendering the table, handling selection, and exporting data. These responsibilities could be separated into smaller, more focused components
- The component could benefit from lazy loading to improve performance
- The component could be refactored to use reactive programming to improve performance and reduce coupling
